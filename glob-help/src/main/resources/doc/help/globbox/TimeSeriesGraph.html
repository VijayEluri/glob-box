<h3>Time Series Graph</h3>

<p>The main analysis tool for the time dimension the GlobToolbox comprises is the Time Series Graph, shown in
    Screenshot 1. It is opened by clicking on <img src="../images/ts-graph-button.png" alt="ts-graph-button">.

</div>

<p>
    This tool may be used to compare values of different measures, such as <code>TSM</code> or <code>SST</code> (given
    by the variables), for the specified Time Series. It allows to show an arbitrary number of variables for the whole
    Time Series. The x-axis determines the point in time, the y-axes represent the unit of the respective variable. In
    the example provided in Screenshot 1, the variables <code>TSM_mean</code> and <code>TSM_count</code> are compared;
    each features its own y-axis. The values shown in the graph are the values at a given pixel position for all points
    in time which are part of the Time Series. The graph always shows the values of the pixel position of the cursor;
    additionally, it allows to show the values of the selected pins or of all pins. For automated analysis or further
    investigation, it allows exporting the values given by the pins to a text file by clicking
    <img src="../images/export.gif" alt="ts-graph-export"> (CSV-format, tab-separated).
