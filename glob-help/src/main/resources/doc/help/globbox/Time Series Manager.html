<h3>Time Series Manager</h3>

<p>
    This page comprises a short definition of Time Series in the context of the BEAM GlobToolbox, and describes how such
    Time Series are created and edited using the GlobToolbox Time Series Manager tool.
</p>

<h4>Time Series Specification</h4>

<p>
    Within the GlobToolbox, a <i>Time Series</i> is specified by several source products and variables. Every product
    comprising remote-sensing bands may be used as source product of a Time Series; Glob*-products in particular.
    However, a Time Series is limited to contain <i>compatible</i> source products, that is, to source products which
    have the same bounds.
</p>

<p>
    Variables in the context of the GlobToolbox are types of bands, such as <code>TSM_mean</code> or <code>SST</code>.
    Thus, a time series comprises several bands of different variables, for example, 4 bands of <code>TSM_mean</code>,
    each originating from a different source product.
</p>

<h4>Time Series Manager Tool</h4>

<p>
    The Time Series Manager, opened by a click on <img src="../images/ts-manager-button.gif" alt="ts-manager-button">,
    allows to define and edit such time series. It provides a wizard which allows to specify source
    products in three different ways: either a directory is scanned for compatible products or a directory is scanned
    together with its sub-directories, or single products may be chosen (see Screenshot 1).
</p>

</div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>
    In the second step, the wizard allows to specify the variables the Time Series shall contain. The list of possible
    variables is derived from the products which have been chosen in the previous step. The second step is displayed in
    Screenshot 2.
</p>

    <div align="center"><font size="2">Screenshot 2 - Specifying the variables</font></div>
</div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>
    After that, the user may assign the Time Series a name and finish the wizard. The Time Series Manager now looks as
    displayed in Screenshot 3: the variables may be selected and de-selected and the product sources may be edited.
    Additionally, information about the Time Series is provided, such as the start and end time, the CRS and the
    dimensions. The view button on the right <img src="../images/view-button.png" alt="view-button"> allows to show one
    of the selected variables in the VISAT Product Scene View.
