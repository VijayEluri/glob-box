<h3>Supported Products</h3>

<p>
    The Glob DUE Reader module provides the capability of reading data products provided by
    multiple Glob DUE projects. This module is the inheritor of the former GlobToolbox. Since
    most functionality of the Toolbox has been moved into BEAM itself this set of reader has left over.
    The following table comprises the supported products:
