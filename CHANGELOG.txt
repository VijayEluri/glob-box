1) New Features

o The readers have been revised; a reader for IGBP data products has been added.

o Glob-products may be exported to a generic NetCDF/CF-format.

o A number of tools tackling the time dimension have been introduced. First of all,
  a time series manager allowing to define and edit time series. A time series player
  allows vividly visualising a time series by providing the control elements for
  navigating through a time series, either manually or automatically. And a time
  series graph has been developed which may be used to compare values of different
  measures, such as TSM or SST, for a specified time series.
