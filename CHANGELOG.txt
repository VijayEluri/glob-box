The time series tool is, since BEAM 4.11, part of the BEAM installation.
Therefore this tool has been removed from the GlobToolbox.
Now the toolbox consists only of multiple product reader for various
Glob DUE data products.
The GlobToolbox is not any longer provided as an add-on installer for BEAM,
but the reader modules can be obtained from the BEAM module repository via
the Module Manager in VISAT.

  allows vividly visualising a time series by providing the control elements for

  series graph has been developed which may be used to compare values of different
  measures, such as TSM or SST, for a specified time series.
